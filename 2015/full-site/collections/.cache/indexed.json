As a Platinum+ sponsor they will have a stand on the day and will have a special 5 minute speaking slot as well, so there will be plenty of opportunities for you to go and have a chat with them on the day. I&#8217;ve also had a rumour about some cool freebies&#8230;</p>\n\n<p>Without sponsors we couldn&#8217;t put on the (R)Evolution, so we really appreciate the help and support we receive from them. If you would like to support us in some way, large or small, have a look at our <a href=\"/assets/REvolution-Sponsorship-2014.pdf\">sponsorship pack</a> or get in touch with us at <a href=\"&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#114;&#101;&#118;&#111;&#108;&#117;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#064;&#115;&#104;&#114;&#111;&#112;&#103;&#101;&#101;&#107;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#046;&#117;&#107;\">&#114;&#101;&#118;&#111;&#108;&#117;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#064;&#115;&#104;&#114;&#111;&#112;&#103;&#101;&#101;&#107;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#046;&#117;&#107;</a>.</p>\n",

Therefore, we asked you guys to submit your talk ideas for that final slot. The response was outstanding! We received a lot of really great ideas, so many in fact, that it made it very hard to choose only one!.</p>\n\n<p>We have, however, now chosen our final speaker for the lineup and we are extremely excited to be able to tell you that it is&#8230;</p>\n\n<h2>Sébastien Cevey</h2>\n\n<p>Sébastien is a software engineer at the Guardian where he leads the development of Composer, the new digital-first CMS. For his talk he will be telling us all about the challenges of creating a content management system for a platform where presentation is no longer controlled, but informed by the content. We are really excited to have Sébastien as part of the lineup and we&#8217;re sure he will be an awesome addition to the day. For the full talk outline check out <a href=\"http://2014.shropgeek-revolution.co.uk/schedule.html\">the schedule</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And a special thank you to everybody that sent in a talk idea. They were awesome, and made it really hard for us to choose just one!</p>\n",
