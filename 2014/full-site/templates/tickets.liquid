                    <p>Tickets will be on general sale through Eventbrite from 10am on April 25th 2014.</p>

                    <p>A limited amount of earlybird tickets will be released first at the price of £69. Once these are sold out, standard tickets will go on sale at £89. Micro sponsor tickets will be available until all tickets are sold.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Shropgeek is not VAT registered and therefore VAT is not applied to the ticket price.</li>
                        <li>Eventbrite fees will be added to the cost of the ticket at checkout.</li>
                        <li>Paypal fees will not be passed on to you.</li>

                    <h3>Micro Sponsors</h3>

                    <p>Micro sponsorship is intended to give individuals and very small companies the opportunity to show their support. Think of it as your chance to support and encourage a "serious" cake habit. The more micro sponsors we get, the more cake we can provide in the breaks! </p>

                    <hr>

                    <h3>Student Tickets</h3>

                    <p>Student tickets have been made available at the reduced price of £45. If you purchase a student ticket, you must produce valid student ID at registration when asked, otherwise you will be charged the full price of a standard ticket.</p>

                    <p>Student tickets do <u>not</u> include a t-shirt on the day or entry to the after party.</p>
