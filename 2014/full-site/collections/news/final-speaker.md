When the website launched in April, we had one more speaker slot to fill. Therefore, we asked you guys to submit your talk ideas for that final slot. The response was outstanding! We received a lot of really great ideas, so many in fact, that it made it very hard to choose only one!.

We have, however, now chosen our final speaker for the lineup and we are extremely excited to be able to tell you that it is...

## Sébastien Cevey

Sébastien is a software engineer at the Guardian where he leads the development of Composer, the new digital-first CMS. For his talk he will be telling us all about the challenges of creating a content management system for a platform where presentation is no longer controlled, but informed by the content. We are really excited to have Sébastien as part of the lineup and we're sure he will be an awesome addition to the day. For the full talk outline check out [the schedule](http://2014.shropgeek-revolution.co.uk/schedule.html).


And a special thank you to everybody that sent in a talk idea. They were awesome, and made it really hard for us to choose just one!
