We are very excited to announce that tickets are now on sale for this years (R)Evolution Conference, which is taking place on Friday 26 September 2014. 

Once again, the conference will be held at Shropshire's only purpose built auditorium at The Shropshire Conference Centre, and you can expect a full day of inspiring talks and great conversation. 

We already have 8 awesome speakers lined up, with one more still to be confirmed. If you think this should be you, then drop us an email before 12th May 2014 outlining your talk idea, and you could be up on that stage in September too! 

We have a limited number of ealrybird tickets available, and once they are gone standard tickets will go on sale for the fantastic price of Â£89.00. We have also introduced a new ticket type for this year, the Micro Sponsor ticket. This is to allow those people who are small businesses or freelancers to support the event at a much more affordable price than our standard sponsorship packages allow. Micro sponsors will be thanked on the day and listed within promotional materials too.

This event really is not to be missed so book your [tickets today](http://2014.shropgeek-revolution.co.uk/tickets.html). 

And finally, we just wanted to say a huge thank you to Martin Wright for designing and developing our fab new website, Stina Jones for the awesome illustrations and Neil Kinnish for the location Map.
