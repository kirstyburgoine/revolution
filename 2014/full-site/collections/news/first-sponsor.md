We are really very pleased to annouce Heart Internet as our first Platinum+ sponsor.

Heart Internet have been fantastic supporters of Shropgeek and the (R)Evolution conference over the years, so its awesome to have them on board again this year! As a Platinum+ sponsor they will have a stand on the day and will have a special 5 minute speaking slot as well, so there will be plenty of opportunities for you to go and have a chat with them on the day. I've also had a rumour about some cool freebies...

Without sponsors we couldn't put on the (R)Evolution, so we really appreciate the help and support we receive from them. If you would like to support us in some way, large or small, have a look at our [sponsorship pack](/assets/REvolution-Sponsorship-2014.pdf) or get in touch with us at [revolution@shropgeek.co.uk](mailto:revolution@shropgeek.co.uk).
